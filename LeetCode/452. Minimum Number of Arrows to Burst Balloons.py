            Question:
            1. This problem must have at least one shoot needed if there is no Ã¸ input?
            2.

            Idea:
            1. Main Idea is to find most overlapped point, that would be efficient to shoot more balloons in less shoot
            2. sort by x1
            3. x2 would be the limit point that it can be shoot
            4. if next balloon has this x2 in interval, it will be bursted in the same shoot
            5. if not, we must have one more shoot to burst that balloon

            Time Complexity:
            O(nlog(n)[sort] + n[traverse])
